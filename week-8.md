> _This week your **team assessment (A2)** will take place. There is no new theory. You can continue working on your matching application and topics_.

## Assessment

Based on your repository, source code and live version you show what you contributed to the team project for back-end. The idea is not to present your feature, **a teacher will look through the code and ask questions**. By answering questions you demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals. _This is an individual test, so they will be conducted between one teacher and one student._

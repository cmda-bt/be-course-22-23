> _This week your **individual assessment (A1)** will take place. There is no new theory. You can continue working on your prototype_.

## Review

In the lab we'll do a **peer review** by having a look at the assessment checklist and grading fellow students based on the rubric. After that teachers have time to answer questions and do some technical troubleshooting.

**A1 peer review:**  
This is the peer review document you will fill-in as duo. You'll perform the checks on the project of your fellow student. It's a good last check to see if everything is in order.

→ [Peer Review][review]

**A1 rubric:**  
This is the rubric your teacher will grade you on during the assessment. Ask yourself upon completion if everything listed on the rubric is clear and that you understand each row and column, if not ask your teacher on MS Teams!

→ [Rubric](/grading/a1.md)

**Questions:**  

If you have any question you can reach the student-assistants and teachers on MS Teams. Make sure you are prepared:

* Ask other students if they encountered the same problem and try ot fix it together.
* Know which questions you want to ask and formulate it clearly.
* If you have a bug, investigate and try to make a detailed explanation of your problem.

## Assessment

Based on your repository, source code and local version you show what feature you've created for back-end. The idea is not to present your feature, **a teacher will look through the code and ask questions**. By answering questions you demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals. _This is an individual test, so they will be conducted between one teacher and one student._
